    + basic knowledge about how to move a div around on the page
    + how to stick a div onto the bottom or top of a page
    + how to set background colors, placing images, etc.
    + how to center an element horizontally
    + find a way how to include the css styles in the page
    + understand how to use classes and ids
    + build a basic form without functionality
